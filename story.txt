Once upon a time, there was a man named Matt who dreamed of becoming the king of the world. However, he was just a poor farmer who lived on the outskirts of town. 
One day, he found a golden egg on the side of the road. He picked it up and went to go sell it at the local store. The man was amazed at this golden egg and offered
him $100,000,000 for it. Matt was shocked at this, and thought the man was joking. However, he was dead serious.
