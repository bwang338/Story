Once upon a time, there was a man named Matt who dreamed of becoming the king of the world. However, he was just a poor farmer who lived on the outskirts of town. 
One day, he found a golden egg on the side of the road. He picked it up and went to go sell it at the local store. The man was amazed at this golden egg and offered
him $100,000,000 for it. Matt was shocked at this, and thought the man was joking. However, he was dead serious. 

Matt happily sold off the egg and began his new life as a rich man. He left his farm and started a business that soon grew to be one of the largest in the world. However, despite 
his every-growing riches, he was still not the king of the world. Matt stayed up late every night thinking of how he could use his wealth to get there. 

Matt suddenly had the greatest idea. He decided to spend years of his life finding the creature who laid that golden egg. He spent years searching the world until he finally found 
the goose that laid golden eggs. So took the goose and took every golden egg it laid and sold each one for great value until he bacame the richest person in the world.
